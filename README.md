#Steps to run the project

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Run "npm install" or other similar command in terminal to install necessary packages
3. Add the project folder to your workspace and position yourself to the folder root
4. Run "npx cypress open" command in terminal

After Cypress test runner opens up:
1. Click on "Exercise.spec.js" file to run the first test script and see the visualisation (dresses.txt file is the one saving the dress names)
2. Click on "Exercise2.spec.js" file to run the second test script and see test results (Not everything was implemented though)
